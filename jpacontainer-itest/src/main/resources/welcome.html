	<h1>Hello Vaadin user!</h1>

	<p>This is an example app using simple JPA annotated datamodel,
		JPAContainer and its FieldFactory to create a basic invoicing app. The
		application uses a generic BasicCrudView helper class to display
		editable views for the domain model. The view lists all entities in a
		Table and connects the selected item into a form below it.</p>

	<p>Forms are build automatically using FieldFactory bundled with
		the JPAContainer. Only visible properties and property order is
		configured per entity type. The FieldFactory excels when if faces
		properties that wrap a reference to another entity type. As where the
		standard Vaadin field factory could only display a dummy text field,
		the JPA specific FieldFactory can make reasonable job creating e.g. a
		select of the referenced type.</p>

	<p>Without FieldFactory writing this kind of small DB based
		software would require lots of boilerplate code. Now it supa simple as
		is its maintenance.</p>

	<p>Below you can see a summary of the magic that JPAContainer FieldFactory does.</p>

	<dl>
		<di> <b>@ManyToOne</b></di>
		<dd>
			Creates a select backed up by a JPAContainer listing all entities of
			referenced type. A SingleSelectTranslator is used to automatically
			convert identifiers to actual referenced entity objects.
			<p>
				Example of a mapped property: @ManyToOne private Address address;<br>
				Default type: NativeSelect
			<p>Example in this demo app: link to Product from InvoiceRow
			<p>Created by #createManyToOneField(EntityContainer, Object,
				Object, Component) method.
			<p>The method #constructReferenceSelect(EntityContainer, Object,
				Object, Component, Class) can be used to override the select type.
				The type can also be set per reference type with
				#setMultiSelectType(Class, Class).
			<p>
		</dd>
		<di> <b>@ManyToMany</b></di>
		<dd>
			Creates a multiselect backed up by a JPAContainer listing all
			entities of the type in the collection. Selected entities will be
			reflected to the collection field in the entity using the
			MultiSelectTranslator.
			<p>Example of a mapped property: @ManyToMany private
				Set&lt;Address&gt; addresses;
			<p>Default type: Table (in multiselect mode)
			<p>Example in this demo app: customers groups and groups
				customers (bidirectional)
			<p>Created by #createManyToManyField(EntityContainer, Object,
				Object, Component) method.
			<p>The method #constructCollectionSelect(EntityContainer, Object,
				Object, Component, Class) can be used to override the select type.
				Type can also be set per reference type with
				#setMultiSelectType(Class, Class).
			<p>
		</dd>
		<di> <b>@OneToMany</b></di>
		<dd>
			Creates a custom field based on Table to edit referenced entities
			"owned" by the master entity. The table lists only entities which
			belong to entity being currently edited. Referenced entities are
			editable straight in the table and instances can be removed and
			added.
			<p>Example of a mapped property: @OneToMany(mappedBy="person",
				cascade=CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true) private
				Set&lt;Address&gt; addresses;
			<p>Default type: MasterDetailEditor (in multiselect mode)
			<p>Example in this demo app: InvoiceRows in Invoice
			<p>Created by #createOneToManyField(EntityContainer, Object,
				Object, Component) method.
			<p>Some things to note:
			<ul>
				<li>Creation of new entities uses empty paramater constructor.</li>
				<li>The master detail editor expects the referenced entity to
					hava a "back reference" to the owner. It needs to be specified in
					with mappedBy parameter in the annotation or it to be "naturally
					named" (master type starting in lowercase).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
		</dd>
		<di> <b>@OneToOne</b></di>
		<dd>
			Creates a sub form for the referenced type. If the value is initially
			null, the sub form tries to create one with empty parameter
			constructor.
			<p>Example of a mapped property: @OneToOne private Address
				addresses;
			<p>Default type: OneToOneForm
			<p>ShippingAddress in Invoice
			<p>Created by #createOneToOneField(EntityContainer, Object,
				Object, Component) method.
			<p>
		</dd>
