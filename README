Forked version of JPAContainer which runs on Vaadin 8 with v7 Grid.

Gradle users: Just add the following repository:

  repositories {
      // for customized version of jpacontainer
      maven {
          url "http://www.baka.sk/maven2"
      }
  }

Then just add the following dependency:

  compile 'com.vaadin.addon:jpacontainer:3.2.0.v8'

By adding this dependency you can continue to use v7.Grid with jpacontainer and gradually convert your project to
v8 Grid with DataProviders. Please read more here: http://mavi.logdown.com/posts/1493424-using-jpacontainer-with-vaadin-8s-v7-compatibility-grid
